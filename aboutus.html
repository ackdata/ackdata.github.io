      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>At Purius Deodorant, we are proud to be completely transparent about what we do. We are not a business that sells antiperspirants, we sell deodorants. What's the difference you ask? Deodorant is used to mask body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. Deodorants contain antimicrobial agents that kill odor-causing bacteria, as well as fragrances to mask any remaining odor. Deodorants do not prevent sweating.

Antiperspirants, on the other hand, are designed to reduce sweating by blocking the sweat glands. They typically contain aluminum-based compounds that form a temporary plug in the sweat ducts, which reduces the amount of sweat that is released. Although there is officially no evidence that antiperspirants cause harm, the National Cancer Institute states “some scientists have suggested that the aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants may contribute to the development of breast cancer” Why take that risk, I know I wont!<p>
      <p> We can not argue the effectiveness of antiperspirants, with some companies boasting up to 72 hour protection. What we can brag about is that our deodorant is chemical free, 100% organic, and vegan friendly. You don't have to read our ingredients and question ‘What the heck is that?”. Our armpits are a very sensitive part of our body, we should try to protect them the best we can, while still maintaining that fresh smell we all need.<p>
