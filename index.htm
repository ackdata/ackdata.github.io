           <h3>Our Commitment to The Planet and Its People</h3>
           <p>At Purius Deodorant, we're committed to helping people and the environment. We believe in producing a deodorant that's not only good for you, but also good for the planet. That's why we've made it our mission to avoid using factories that release harmful chemicals into the environment, and instead, all of our products are handcrafted in small batches in our own facility. Our containers are made from biodegradable paper, so you can dispose of them after use without any environmental impact. We take pride in our efforts to create a better world, one deodorant at a time, and we hope you'll join us in our mission. </p>
